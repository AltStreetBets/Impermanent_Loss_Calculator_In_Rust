# Impermanent_Loss_Calculator_In_Rust
An impermanent loss calculator which works based on price but also on tokens before and tokens after.

It works in the short testing I did.


updated main.rs to the calculator with interface. You can run it yourself, or download the .exe file.

adding multiple adds is now located in the other .rs file because the formula is not 100% correct for adding multiple adds. Weighted values are a bitch, and math is its pimp
